## Cansat
The project "Cansat" is a french competition where multiple teams of 6 members compete in order to make the best satellite (at least device that can measures temperature and humidity).
This is the project that we made me and my team

# Pico w

This is the folder where all the programs of the station are stored. We used a Raspberry PI pico w to host a webpage that regularly refreshes in order to display the last datas (hour, temperature, humidity, pressure, air quality)

# Pico 

This is the folder where all the programs of satellite are stored. We used a Raspberry PI pico to measure temperature, humidity, pressure and air.

Both of those microcontrollers communicate thanks to the uart protocole.
